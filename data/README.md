# Datasets

This folder contains the datasets used in the **Practical Assignment for Machine Learning I (CC2008, 2024/2025)**.

## Source
All datasets were originally provided in the package `class_imbalance.zip` by the course instructors.  

For clarity and reproducibility, **only the datasets actually used in this project** are included here. The remaining datasets from the original package are intentionally omitted.

## Notes
- Some datasets included in the original `class_imbalance.zip` package were **not used** and are therefore not included here.
- The datasets above were specifically chosen because they illustrate challenges related to **class imbalance** in binary classification tasks.
- Data files are kept in their raw form under `data/raw/`. Any preprocessing performed during the experiments is documented in the notebook.
